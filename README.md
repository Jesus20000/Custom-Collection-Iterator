Custom Collection Iterator - Python Project

Overview:
This project demonstrates the Iterator Design Pattern using a custom collection of books.
It simulates a digital library archive where users can iterate over books using a custom iterator.

Project Structure:
- book.py: Defines the Book class with title, author, and category.
- book_iterator.py: Implements the BookIterator class for custom iteration.
- book_collection.py: Manages the collection of Book objects.
- main.py: Demonstrates the usage of the iterator.

How to Run:
1. Make sure all four files are in the same folder.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the project folder.
4. Run the main file using the command:

   python main.py

Expected Output:
Library Collection:
'1984' by George Orwell [Dystopia]
'The Hobbit' by J.R.R. Tolkien [Fantasy]
'Clean Code' by Robert C. Martin [Programming]

Goal:
- Understand and apply the Iterator Design Pattern.
- Learn how to separate data storage logic from iteration logic.
