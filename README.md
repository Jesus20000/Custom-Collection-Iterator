Got it — thanks for the screenshot!

You're right: the horizontal scroll and broken formatting in the **Project Structure** section looks **bad in GitHub** due to the long comment-style lines.

Let me give you a **visually clean and properly wrapped `README.md`**, perfect for GitHub rendering — no horizontal scroll, clean sections, emoji headers, and a neatly listed project structure.

# 📚 Custom Collection Iterator

This project demonstrates the **Iterator Design Pattern** in Python by building a digital archive system for managing a book collection. It allows you to create and traverse a custom collection of books using your own iterator, keeping data storage and traversal logic cleanly separated.

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python 3.x  
- Object-Oriented Programming  
- Iterator Design Pattern

---

## 🧠 Pattern: Iterator

The **Iterator Pattern** provides a way to access elements of a collection sequentially without exposing its internal structure. It supports clean, extensible iteration over any type of custom collection.

## 📁 Project Structure

```

custom-collection-iterator/
├── book.py             # Book class with title, author, category
├── book\_iterator.py    # Custom iterator class for books
├── book\_collection.py  # Stores and manages the list of books
├── main.py             # Client script to demonstrate iteration
└── README.md           # Project documentation

```

## 🚀 Features

- Add books to a custom collection  
- Iterate through books using a user-defined iterator  
- Clean and modular OOP-based design  
- Easy to extend (e.g., filter by author, sort by title)
